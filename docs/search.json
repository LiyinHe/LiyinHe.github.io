I am actively looking for dedicated and enthusiastic PhD students, Postdoctoral researchers, and visiting scholars to join our team. Please contact me he.liyin@duke.edu by including your CV, anticipated start date and research interests.\nMy research focuses on understanding the interrelationship between air, water, and ecosystem in the face of climate change, elevated CO2, air pollution, and different management practices. I use three main approaches: 1) spatiotemporal data analysis to interpret field and satellite observations; 2) machine learning approaches to generate novel datasets; and 3) process-based terrestrial biosphere models to understand the underlying mechanism. My work encompasses a wide range of scales—from the micro-level interactions within individual plants to macro-level regional and global patterns.\n\n\nCarnegie Institution for Science (at Stanford University) | Aug 2022 - now\n\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate at Department of Global Ecology\nSupervisor: Dr. Lorenzo Rosa\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology | Ph.D | Sep 2016 - Jul 2022\n\nMajor: Environmental Science & Engineering\nMinor: Applied and Computational Mathematics\nThesis Advisory Committee: Dr. Christian Frankenberg (advisor), Dr. Paul Wennberg (chair), Dr. Yuk Yung and Dr. David Schimel\nThesis: Agriculture and Its Role in the Global Carbon Cycle\n\nNanjing University | B.S |Sep 2012 - Jun 2016\n\nMajor: Geographic Information Science (with honor)\n\nMinor: Financial Engineering"

    "text": "My research explores the complex relationships among Carbon-Air-Water in the face of climate change, elevated atmospheric CO2, air pollution, and different management practices. I use an integrated earth-system framework to study terrestrial ecology that connects:\n\nPlant Ecology (Terrestrial Carbon Cycle)\nClimatology (Air Quality and Climate)\nHydrology (Water Resources)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon-Air-Water Nexus\nMy work encompasses a wide range of scales—from the micro-level interactions within individual plants to macro-level regional and global patterns. Across different scales, I use different sensing technologies, including leaf gas-exchange system, eddy covariance measurements, and ground/airborne/satellite remote sensing. The knowledge gained from these data-driven approaches are crucial for improving ecosystem models and calibrating parameters, enabling more accurate predictions of ecosystem trajectories under climate change. These scientific insights will be leveraged to empower policymakers and stakeholders to develop more effective and targeted strategies for climate adaptation and mitigation."
