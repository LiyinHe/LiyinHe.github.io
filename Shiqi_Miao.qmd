Shiqi will join Duke University as a Ph.D. student in Ecology in August 2025, working with Prof. Liyin He. She is interested in addressing interdisciplinary challenges at the nexus of climate change, terrestrial ecosystems, urban thermal dynamics, and public health. By integrating remote sensing, modeling, and data science approaches, she seeks to advance scientific understanding and inform practical strategies for urban climate resilience. 

Prior to Duke, she earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Nanjing University under the guidance of Prof. Wenfeng Zhan. There, she investigated thermal remote sensing applications with a focus on the synergy between heatwaves and urban heat island effects. 

Shiqi was awarded the <a href="https://gradschool.duke.edu/financial-support/find-funding/james-b-duke-fellowship/" target="_blank">James B. Duke Fellowship</a>, a prestigious and competitive award given to outstanding incoming Ph.D. students. Recipients are nominated by their department and selected by a university-wide faculty committee.
