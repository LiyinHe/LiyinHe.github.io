# Interested in joining the group?

I am actively looking for dedicated and enthusiastic PhD students, Postdoctoral researchers, and visiting students/scholars to join our team. There will be flexibility regarding scientific questions to be studied, but potential areas of focus include: 

- Advance understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle by employing eddy covariance measurements, airborne/satellite remote sensing, atmospheric inversions, and Earth system modeling.

- Investigate how various ecosystems, including agroecosystems, forests, urban ecosystems, drylands, and permafrost, respond to extreme events such as droughts, heatwaves, floods, wildfires, and hurricanes.

- Evaluate the potential impact of nature-based solutions on carbon sequestration and agricultural sustainability. 

Please contact me <liyin.he@duke.edu> by including your CV, anticipated start date and research interests.
