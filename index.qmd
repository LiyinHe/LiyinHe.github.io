**I will join [Nicholas School of the Environment (NSOE)](https://nicholas.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) as an assistant professor in Jan 2025!** I am actively looking for dedicated and enthusiastic PhD students, Postdoctoral researchers, and visiting scholars to join our team. Please contact me <he.liyin@duke.edu> by including your CV, anticipated start date and research interests.

My research focuses on understanding the **interrelationship between air, water, and ecosystem** in the face of climate change, elevated CO~2~, air pollution, and different management practices. I use three main approaches: 1) **spatiotemporal data analysis** to interpret field and satellite observations; 2) **machine learning approaches** to generate novel datasets; and 3) **process-based terrestrial biosphere models** to understand the underlying mechanism. My work encompasses a wide range of scalesâ€”from the **micro-level interactions within individual plants** to **macro-level regional and global patterns**.
